        <h2>About This Map</h2>
        <p>This is a GEG212 final assignment. There are two of my drawing walking routes in this Leaflet Map, one for daytime and the other for evening. The daytime one is located in Central Park, which is drawn by a yellow line. I decided to pick that for several reasons. As an immigrant, I had never seen a park as big as Central Park before, especially located in a busy borough, Manhattan. Walking in Central Park helps me maintain my physical and mental health during the period of transition into a new culture. It particularly reduced my anxiety, and improved overall well-being when I was facing the challenges of adapting to a new environment. Along the walking route, there are few markers and buildings I highlight. Starting from the 81st bus station and going into Central Park, I will see Shakespeare Garden where it can totally free my mind. Then walking up for not long, there is Delacorte Theater. If lucky, I can enjoy free Shakespeare theater in summer time. As I walk around, a pond is beside me, which is a Turtle Pond known for a lot of turtles. Finally, The Metropolitan Museum of Art is near the walking route. It is a museum that visitors will not want to miss. In general, Central Park is a good choice for me to have a daytime walk whether alone or with family or friends, whether I want to have exercise or just relieve my stress. The evening walking route I drew in a blue line is in Brooklyn Bridge Park. Looking up in the park, Brooklyn Bridge is in front of me where cars are moving along. I really enjoy watching cars going in different directions at night. It is one way I can see the busyness of the city. As I keep walking, there is a basketball court, where I can play basketball with my friends or perhaps meet new friends. If I feel tired afterward, I can walk forward for not long to Pier 3 Plaza. There is a large lawn where I can relax while lying and looking up at the sky. It is also a good place where I can walk my dog. Finally, there is a small beach in front. In the afternoon, I can have a sea-hunting experience there. If possible, I can have a seat there watching the sea and talking with my friends. Last but not least in this map, there are hurricane evacuation zones by level. If the color of that area gets deeper, this is a place we should keep away from during hurricanes. Red areas are the most dangerous ones since they are close to the sea. Within this map, we can have a better idea where to go during the hurricane.</p>
        <p>GIS provides me another way to visualize the world. When I studied the QGIS software, I realized it integrates all the data and represents a more understanding and vivid map to me instead of a bunch of boring data. It also provides practical information to people in a more direct way through a map. For example, from the property research we did on the last assignment, we know people or house agents who want to buy or sell a house definitely need those maps to consider the profits of the business. Last but not least, since my major is computer science, creating the maps whether by QGIS or this online map helps me become familiar with software and website making.</p>
